Support for running Jasmine tests in a Gradle build. And more.

* Your Jasmine specs run against source code in situ, as well as part of the build

* Easy to include JSLint reports with the Jasmine output.

* Supports mulitple dashboard pages that aggregate Jasmine SpecRunners.

* Build fails if Jasmine and/or JSLint fail. Or not, if you prefer.

* jasmineGenerate creates template files and required libraries in src/test/javascript

* Build to play nice with others.

Same licensing as Jasmine and JSLint.
